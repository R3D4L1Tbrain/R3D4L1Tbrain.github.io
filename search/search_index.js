Each IP address identifies the device\u2019s host network\u00a0and the location of the device on the host network. When one device sends data to another, the data includes a \u2018header\u2019 that includes the IP address of the sending device\u00a0and the IP address of the destination device.</p> </li> <li> <p>Nodes: A node is a connection point inside a network that can receive, send, create, or store data. Each node requires you to provide some form of identification to receive access, like an IP address. A few examples of nodes include computers, printers, modems, bridges, and switches. A node is essentially any network device that can recognize, process, and transmit information to any other network node.</p> </li> <li>Routers: A router is a physical or virtual device that sends information contained in data packets between networks. Routers analyze data within the packets to determine the best way for the information to reach its ultimate destination. Routers forward data packets until they reach their destination node.</li> <li> <p>Switches: A switch is a device that connects other devices and manages node-to-node communication within a network, ensuring data packets reach their ultimate destination. While a router sends information between networks, a switch sends information between nodes in a single network. When discussing computer networks, \u2018switching\u2019 refers to how data is transferred between devices in a network. The three main types of switching are as follows:</p> </li> <li> <p>Circuit switching, which establishes a dedicated communication path between nodes in a network. This dedicated path assures the full bandwidth is available during the transmission, meaning no other traffic can travel along that path.</p> </li> <li>Packet switching involves breaking down data into independent components called packets which, because of their small size, make fewer demands on the network. The packets travel through the network to their end destination.</li> <li> <p>Message switching\u00a0sends a message in its entirety from the source node, traveling from switch to switch until it reaches its destination node.</p> </li> <li> <p>Ports: A port identifies a specific connection between network devices. Each port is identified by a number. If you think of an IP address as comparable to the address of a hotel, then ports are the suites or room numbers within that hotel. Computers use port numbers to determine which application, service, or process should receive specific messages.</p> </li> <li> <p>Network cable types: The most common network cable types are Ethernet twisted pair, coaxial, and fiber optic.

This is achieved through the use of\u00a0netmasks**, which allow you to define which bits of the IP address correspond to the**\u00a0network\u00a0and which bits correspond to the\u00a0hosts**.</p> <p>To interpret a netmask, the bits that are in \"1\" must be identified. These bits represent the portion of the IP address that corresponds to the\u00a0network. For example, a netmask of\u00a0255.255.255.0\u00a0indicates that the first\u00a0three octets\u00a0of the IP address correspond to the\u00a0network, while the\u00a0last octet\u00a0is used to identify the\u00a0hosts.</p> <p>Now, when we talk about\u00a0CIDR\u00a0(acronym for\u00a0Classless Inter-Domain Routing), what we are referring to is a more efficient and flexible method of assigning IP addresses than the use of fixed IP network classes. With\u00a0CIDR, an IP address is represented by a base IP address and a netmask, which are written together separated by a slash (/).</p> <p>For example, the IP address\u00a0192.168.1.1.1\u00a0with a netmask of\u00a0255.255.255.0\u00a0would be written as\u00a0192.168.1.1/24.</p> <p>The netmask is represented in prefix notation, which indicates the number of bits that are in \"1\" in the mask. In this case, the netmask\u00a0255.255.255.0\u00a0has\u00a024\u00a0bits in \"1\" (the first three octets), so its prefix notation is\u00a0/24.</p> <p>To calculate the netmask from a prefix notation, you must write the \"1\" bits in the first bits of a 32-bit IP address and the \"0\" bits in the remaining bits. For example, the\u00a0/24\u00a0netmask would be calculated as\u00a0111111111111.111111111111.111111111111.00000000\u00a0in binary, which is equivalent to\u00a0255.255.255.0\u00a0in decimal.</p> <p>It is important to note that in addition to these three types of network masks,\u00a0there are also custom network masks\u00a0that can be used to create subnets of different sizes within a network.</p> <p>As mentioned in the previous class description of CIDRs (Classless Inter-Domain Routing), this is a method of IP address assignment that allows an IP address to be split into a part that identifies\u00a0the network\u00a0and another part that identifies\u00a0the host. This is achieved through the use of a\u00a0network mask, which is represented in\u00a0CIDR\u00a0notation as a\u00a0base IP address\u00a0followed by a number indicating the\u00a0amount of bits\u00a0that correspond to the network.</p> <p>With\u00a0CIDR, IP addresses can be assigned\u00a0more precisely, reducing the number of wasted IP addresses and facilitating network administration.</p> <p>The number following the base IP address in CIDR notation is called\u00a0prefix\u00a0or\u00a0prefix length, and represents the\u00a0number of bits\u00a0in the netmask that are in \"1\".</p> <p>For example, an IP address with a\u00a0/24\u00a0prefix indicates that the first\u00a024 bits\u00a0of the IP address correspond to the\u00a0network, while the remaining\u00a08 bits\u00a0are used to identify the\u00a0hosts.</p> <p>To calculate the number of hosts available on a CIDR network, one must count the number of \"0\" bits in the netmask and raise\u00a02 to the power\u00a0of that number. This is because each \"0\" bit in the netmask represents a bit that can be used to identify a host.</p> <p>For example, a netmask of\u00a0255.255.255.0\u00a0(/24) has\u00a08 bits\u00a0in \"0\", which means that there are\u00a02^8 = 256\u00a0IP addresses available to hosts on that network.</p> <p>Some practical examples of CIDR are depicted below:</p> <ul> <li>An IP address with a\u00a0/28\u00a0prefix (255.255.255.240) allows up to\u00a016 IP addresses\u00a0for hosts (2^4), since the first\u00a028 bits\u00a0correspond to the network.</li> <li>An IP address with a prefix of\u00a0/26\u00a0(255.255.255.255.192) allows up to\u00a064 IP addresses\u00a0for hosts (2^6), as the first\u00a026 bits\u00a0correspond to the network.</li> <li>An IP address with a prefix of\u00a0/22\u00a0(255.255.255.252.0) allows up to\u00a01024 IP addresses\u00a0for the hosts (2^10), as the first\u00a022 bits\u00a0correspond to the network.</li> </ul> <p></p> <p>for practice:</p> <ul> <li>https://www.ipaddressguide.com/cidr</li> <li>https://blog.jodies.de/ipcalc</li> </ul>"},{"location":"COMPUTER_SCIENCE/COMPUTER_NETWORKS/switches.html","title":"Switches","text":""},{"location":"COMPUTER_SCIENCE/COMPUTER_NETWORKS/switches.html#access-methods","title":"Access Methods","text":""},{"location":"COMPUTER_SCIENCE/COMPUTER_NETWORKS/switches.html#console","title":"Console","text":"<p>physical management port, make initial configurations </p>"},{"location":"COMPUTER_SCIENCE/COMPUTER_NETWORKS/switches.html#secure-shellssh","title":"Secure Shell(SSH)","text":"<p>Establish a secure remote CLI, recommended method to connect remotely. </p>"},{"location":"COMPUTER_SCIENCE/COMPUTER_NETWORKS/switches.html#telnet","title":"Telnet","text":"<p>Establishes an insecure remote CLI connection to a device over the network.</p>"},{"location":"COMPUTER_SCIENCE/COMPUTER_NETWORKS/switches.html#principals-commands","title":"Principals Commands","text":"<ul> <li> <p><code>&gt;</code> for user mode and <code>#</code> for privilege mode  <pre><code>enable,exit                   # switch between users\n</code></pre></p> </li> <li> <p>Start Configure </p> </li> <li> <p>Change Name </p> </li> <li> <p>Protect EXEC mode access with cisco as password </p> </li> <li> <p>Secure access to EXEC mode as class password </p> </li> <li> <p>Secure access to the VTY line <code>VTY lines allow remote access via Telnet or SSH</code>. </p> </li> <li> <p>encrypt passwords  <pre><code>configure terminal\nservice password-encryption\nexit\n</code></pre></p> </li> </ul> <p>Tip</p> <p>use the <code>show running-config</code> command to verify the running config, <code>show startup-config</code> for the config saved and <code>copy running-config startup-config</code> for update config</p> <ul> <li> <p>banner <pre><code>configure terminal\nbanner motd #copy banner here#\n</code></pre></p> </li> <li> <p>configure virtual interfaces for remote access to switch </p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"COMPUTER_SCIENCE/COMPUTER_NETWORKS/switches.html#ssh-connect","title":"SSH Connect","text":"basic configs<pre><code>enable\nconfigure terminal\nno ip domain-lookup\n\n# create password  to EXEC mode\n\nline console 0\nlogin\n\nline vty 0 15\npassword cisco\nlogin\n\n# crete banner \nbanner motd $ authorized Users Only! $\n\n# config intervaface\ninterface wlan 1\nip address 192.168.1.11 255.255.255.0   # ip address &lt;IP&gt; &lt;NETMASK&gt;\nnot shutdown\n\n# saved configs\n</code></pre> configure the switch for ssh connectivity<pre><code>ip domain-name ccna-lab.com\ncrypto key generate rsa modulus 1024\nusername admin secret cisco\n\nline vty 0 15 \ntransport input telnet ssh\nlogin local\nend\n</code></pre> <p>Start PuTTY and connect </p>"},{"location":"COMPUTER_SCIENCE/COMPUTER_NETWORKS/tcp_ip_protocol.html","title":"TCP_IP Model","text":"<p>Is a set of open standard protocols used on the Internet.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"COMPUTER_SCIENCE/COMPUTER_NETWORKS/tcp_ip_protocol.html#communication-process","title":"Communication Process","text":"<p>Compare with OSI model </p>"},{"location":"COMPUTER_SCIENCE/CYBER_SECURITY/cybersecurity.html","title":"Cybersecurity","text":"<p>the practice of defending computers, servers, mobile devices, electronic systems, networks, and data from malicious attacks.

This will allow us to access services running inside the container from the outside.</p> <p>To use port forwarding, the \"-p\" or \"-publish\" option is used in the \"docker run\" command. This option is used to specify port forwarding and can be used in several ways. For example, if you want to redirect port 80 of the host to port 8080 of the container, you can use the following syntax:</p> <p>\u279c <code>docker run -p 80:8080 my_image</code>.</p> <p>This will redirect any incoming traffic on port 80 of the host to port 8080 of the container. If you wish to specify a protocol other than the default TCP protocol, you can use the \"-p\" option with a different format. For example, if you want to redirect port 53 of the host to port 53 of the container using the UDP protocol, you can use the following syntax:</p> <p>\u279c <code>docker run -p 53:53/udp my_image</code>.</p> <p>Mounts**, on the other hand, allow us to share a directory or file between the host system and the container. This will allow us to persist information between container runs and share data between different containers.</p> <p>To use the mounts, the \"-v\" or \"-volume\" option is used in the \"docker run\" command. This option is used to specify the mount and can be used in several ways. For example, if you want to mount the \"/home/user/data\" directory of the host to the \"/data\" directory of the container, you can use the following syntax:</p> <p>\u279c <code>docker run -v /home/user/data:/data my_image</code>.</p> <p>This will mount the \"/home/user/data\" directory of the host into the \"/data\" directory of the container. If you wish to specify an additional option, such as mounting the directory in read-only mode, you can use the \"-v\" option with a different format.
